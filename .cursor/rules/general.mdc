# Basketball Stats Keeper - General Rules

## Project Context
This is a basketball statistics tracking app built following the **FIBA Statisticians' Manual 2024**. The core goal is **speed** - capture any stat in under 2 seconds during live games.

## Key References
- Project Overview: @specs/overview.md
- Data Models: @specs/data-models.md
- FIBA Manual: specs/documents-corporate-fiba-statisticians-manual-2024.pdf

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Speed First
- Any common stat recordable in ≤ 2 taps
- No confirmation dialogs during live play
- Large tap targets (min 48x48px)
- Response time < 100ms

### 2. FIBA Compliance
- All stats follow FIBA definitions
- Support all turnover types (Appendix B)
- Calculate advanced stats per Appendix C
- Handle edge cases (goaltending, own basket, etc.)

### 3. Data Persistence
- SQLite database for server-side storage
- Auto-save after every action
- No data loss on crash/close
- API routes for all data operations

## Implementation Guidelines

### Before Writing Code
1. Check the spec file for the feature
2. Use data models from `specs/data-models.md`
3. Follow FIBA rules for stat definitions
4. Implement all acceptance criteria

### Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode - no `any` types
- Named exports for components
- Client Components for live scoring (needs state)
- Large, accessible tap targets
