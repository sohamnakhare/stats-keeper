# Game Setup Feature Rules

## Spec Reference
Always refer to the game setup spec: @specs/features/game-setup.md

## Key Requirements
- Create game with home/away teams
- Add players with jersey numbers (0-99, unique per team)
- Select exactly 5 starters per team
- Designate 1 captain per team (must be starter)
- Save team templates for reuse

## Components
- `NewGameForm` - Initial game creation
- `RosterEditor` - Add/edit players
- `StartingFiveSelector` - Visual starter selection
- `TeamTemplateSelector` - Load saved rosters

## Data Types
- `Game` - Core game entity
- `Team` - Team with players
- `Player` - Number, name, position, captain flag
- `TeamTemplate` - Saved roster for reuse

## Validation
| Field | Rules |
|-------|-------|
| Team name | Required, 2-30 chars |
| Short name | Required, exactly 3 chars |
| Player number | 0-99, unique per team |
| Starters | Exactly 5 required |
| Captain | Exactly 1, must be starter |

## UX Goals
- Setup with templates: ~30 seconds
- Full setup (new teams): ~5 minutes
- Clear visual feedback on validation errors
